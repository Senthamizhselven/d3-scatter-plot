# d3-scatter-plot
A course project of a d3 scatter plot which plots the visualisation of how the life expectancy of the world increased with increase in GDP per capita.

I created this as part of the udemy course I am taking on d3. The graph shows the increase in life expectancy since 1800 with the increase in GDP per capita. 
The size of the circles are relative to the size of the population of the countries.
I used d3.tip for the tooltip functionality and a little bit of jquery for event handling.
